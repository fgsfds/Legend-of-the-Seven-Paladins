ABOUT
==========================================================================

  Legend of the Seven Paladins 3D ("搖滾少林系列之 七俠五義3D",
literally "Rock'n'Roll Shaolin Series: The Seven Heroes and Five Gallants 3D")
is a Taiwanese game made by a company named Accend. 3D Realms was negotiating
a deal with the Asian company for their Build Engine, but according to
3D Realms staff, the contract didn't came to be, and they thought Accend
never developed more than a demo based on their engine.

  Turns out, though, that they not only finished the project (which makes
Legend of the Seven Paladins the first commercially released Build Engine
game), but even licensed it out further to the Koreans, which adjusted some
graphics and the story to squeeze the game into a Korean historical setting.

  TWIM was responsible for the adjustments, while SKC published the product.

  The second part of the name (七俠五義) actually refers to the 19th century
Chinese novel "The Seven Heroes and Five Gallants", but wrongly translated
as "Legend of Seven Paladins" by the devs.

THE STORY
==========================================================================

  Any strange thing can happen in this city in the middle of the night.
  When you were riding a lonely last train, an anomaly happened at the
border between Yin and Yang.
  History is like an indifferent vortex: even a nobody like you,
once caught into it, can reveal the truth behind a dynasty conspiracy...
